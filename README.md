# generic-lexer
A simple header-only lexer that can produce token streams for languages with C-like syntax, written in orthodox C++.
Widely undocumented and unclean code.

Known flaws:

None. This is a flawless, bug-free piece of software.

Seriously I don't know of any obvious bugs at the time of this writing but I don't guarantee bug-freeness.
